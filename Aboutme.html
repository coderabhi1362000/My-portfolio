    <div class="Introduction">As a recent graduate with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Panjab University, I am eager to embark on my career as a data analyst. My academic background has equipped me with a solid foundation in statistical analysis, data visualization, and programming languages such as Java,Python and SQL. I have hands-on experience with tools like Excel and Tableau, which I have used to analyze complex datasets and derive actionable insights. My passion for data-driven decision-making and my keen analytical skills drive me to continuously learn and adapt in this ever-evolving field. I am excited to bring my fresh perspective and enthusiasm to a dynamic team where I can contribute to impactful projects and grow as a professional.
